test of dual pixels enhancement:
In an article, I found the great app by Rahul Garg and others which allows saving dual pixel sensor signals from certain iPhones. I would like to enhance this app by saving the dual pixel signals from all pixels, not only the averaged values of green pixels. At one point, I may have to contact the authors of the article.
